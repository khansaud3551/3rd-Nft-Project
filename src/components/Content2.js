              In last one year or so, we have seen many different NFT projects
              in different art style. Suddenly, we think we should make a meme
              style NFT by ourselves and it should be fun and somehow goofy.
              Then Rage Fkers came to our mind. Rage is taken from the rage
              comics, which is our favorate meme and one of the greatest meme in
              internet history. And Fkers is kinda influenced by mfers, which is
              made by Sartoshi in November 2021. With this Rage Fkers
              collection, we want to build the most famous Web 3 NFT brand
              (owned by community) and one of the most widely recognized NFT
              PFPs(Profile Pictures).
