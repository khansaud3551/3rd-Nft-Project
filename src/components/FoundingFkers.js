            Crypto Fkers are made by 2 meme artists together: Brian (Discord:
            Brian.CryptoFker#3741) and JJBB (Discord: JJBB#0881). Brian acts as
            the Chief Creativity Fker who comes up with all different traits
            ideas and sketched drafts. Then JJBB made the drawing with more
            details and fine tunes them. As we believe that the art itself is
            more important than the makers, we choose to remain semi-anonymous.
            But you can always reach us in Discord.
